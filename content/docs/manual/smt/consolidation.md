title: swift mapping tool data consolidation
---

You will find the consolidation context menu on the model set and own
models tab. See the screenshots below.

-   See also: `whydataconsolidation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

-   Consolidation with DB data means, that the latest DB data on your
    disk (you can use the launcher to update those files) will be used
    and merged with your model or model set data. This is useful
    whenever new DB data are available.

    > -   Hint : When you start the mapping tool the latest DB data will
    >     always be downloaded
    > -   Another way to obtain the DB data is with the launcher, see
    >     `launcher`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    > -   You can keep your mapping tool data up to date while working
    >     with the `backupdate`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

-   Consolidation with \"own models\" data means that the latest data
    from your own models installed will be merged with the data in the
    model set. This is required only when the model data on your disk
    change.
