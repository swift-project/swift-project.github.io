title: Excluded models in mapping tool
---

Some models are marked as x **excluded** (meaning in that context here,
that the model shall not be used for matching). Typical reasons for that
are:

-   XPlane `.acf` models (flyable aircraft) cannot be used for matching.
    See `xplanemapping`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} .

-   Some AI models for FSX/P3D do not show valid aircraft and are
    therefor excluded.

-   Legal reasons might lead to excluded models.

-   Some models exists, but are known to be buggy/malfunctional or
    consume too many resources

-   **It is still useful to create mappings for such models!**, see
    `reverselookup`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    > -   for automatic flight plan information
    > -   for the login ICAO data
    > -   for reverse lookup between swift clients (more detailed info
    >     used for matching)

Normally **excluded** models are not used in a model set, but there
might be exceptions (we cannot verify all cases)
