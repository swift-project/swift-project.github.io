title: XPlane follow aircraft view
---

To follow aircraft in X-Plane you can use \"follow aircraft\"

-   aircraft can be selected from the *XSwiftBus* menu or from the
    *Aircraft* widget in swiftGUI (select an aircraft from the list ==\>
    right-click ==\> Display and render models ==\> Follow in simulator)
-   to **change**your **point of view** (view direction), keep your
    *spacebar* pressed and move your mouse
-   to **increase/decrease** the **distance** to the plane, use {key
    arrowdown} / {key arrowup}
-   you can also **change the standard distance** for flight following.
    In *swiftGUI* select the *Settings* widget ==\> Simulator ==\> click
    on the \[\...\] icon next to *X-Plane*. This will open a new window
    where you can change the standard distance. The unit is in metres,
    1m = 3.28ft. Please note that changes will only take affect after
    you restart X-Plane.
