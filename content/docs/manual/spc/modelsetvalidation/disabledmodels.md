title: Why do I see disabled models (models in red)
---

Model validation
================

We recommend to run model validation if a model fails, see
`modelsetvalidation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`modelsetvalidationexample`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} . However,
sometimes models fail even though there is no validation error.

Disabled models in client
=========================

\# If a model fails to be added to the simulator it will be marked in
red.

\# Normally you will see a corresponding message in the simulator
messages
