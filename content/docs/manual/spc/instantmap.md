Having a mapping of the \"own\" (i.e. the flown) aircraft in the
database is a CONVENIENCE feature. You can always manually set the ICAO
code for aircraft/airline in the login screen.
:::

You can directly create a `new mapping <mm>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} from the login page. So when you see the model you are
flying in not yet in the swift database please help us and provide the
correct information. Other users will appreciate your support.

Use the little green swift button to launch the wizard. Go thru the
different values and fill in the values. These values will be used as
filter values in the following pages.

On the aircraft ICAO page you need to select the appropriate entry. The
value are filtered by the values from the first page, but you could also
clear the filter and search values from the scratch.

Now there are two options

1.  you will see an airline based list
2.  or a search form the closest color livery

Assigning a distributor will later allow to set preference or filters

You are almost done, a last verification to check if the data are
correct.

It can take a moment before you see the mapping, see
`nodbmodel`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
