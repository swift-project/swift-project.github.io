title: swift and FSUIPC
---

-   For //swift //+ FS9 FSUIPC is required (mandatory)
-   For //swift //+ FSX/P3D is normally not needed and optional (you
    could use it to query XPDR state/ident). but normally the SimConnect
    SB4 synchronization should already work, see
    `sbareasettings`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
