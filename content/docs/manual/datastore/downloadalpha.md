alpha/developer versions are early access versions for testing. We
recommend to keep a more stable version in parallel.

Download alpha
==============

1.  To download alpha you need to go here:
    <https://datastore.swift-project.org/>

2.  Login with your VATSIM SSO account and create an account

    > 1.  If already approved, you see the download page, you are good
    >     to go!
    > 2.  If not, you\'ll see an info that your account awaits approval
    > 3.  If your VATSIM account has expired, get that fixed,
    >     `see here <qa>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

3.  Now you can ask for a tester account (same as alpha account) - but
    for that **we need at least need your real name or VATSIM id**.
    Otherwise we cannot find you in the user list.

4.  You should see a link to the download page (see below). If you **DO
    NOT SEE this link** let us know so we can enable you as tester.

1.  After we have enabled the link you need logoff -\> login again
    before the link becomes visible

We need your real name, or your VATSIM id, to grant access for developer
versions. Just by your nickname (like \"TheFlyingDude\") we can NOT find
your account!
