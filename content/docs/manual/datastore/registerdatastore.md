-   If you are a VATSIM user: [Register for SSO
    (Single-Sign-On)](https://datastore.swift-project.org) with your
    VATSIM account, then you can use your VATSIM credentials with the
    swift mapping database.
-   After you have registered [here
    (SSO)](https://datastore.swift-project.org) a swift admin will
    approve your account.

-   If you are not a VATSIM member use the the chatroom to request an
    account
-   You can register your email with swift datastore to allow a reset of
    your password and receive notifications. However, as best practice
    we advice you to use a secondary email in case something goes wrong
    (but this general advice is true for all public services and not
    swift only).
