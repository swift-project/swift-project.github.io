title: 'I do not see other planes, no other aircraft, no other traffic'

-   If you fail to see other aircraft please check:
    `notrendered`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   Top 4 XPlane problems:
```
Based on yesterday's experience, there are 4 top problems using //swift// and XPlane

* no models are shown / no other aircraft, in most of the cases the aircraft folder is in the wrong place. see [here]({{< ref "notrendered" >}}) or you did not create a model set
* landing gear not visible or always visible: conflict with other pilot client, remove any other pilot client or AI traffic plugin you have installed, e.g. XSquawkBox, X-IvAp, PilotEdge, WorldTraffic.
* aircraft are too high or low: The offset fix is not installed or incorrectly installed. [See here]({{< ref "xplanecg" >}}) 
* If you **move your model folder you need to reload your models in the mapping tool and recreate the model set** [see]({{< ref "createms" >}}) 
```
