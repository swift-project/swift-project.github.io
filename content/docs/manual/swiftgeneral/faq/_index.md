**pilot client**

-   \"My hotkey PTT does not work\", see `hotkeys`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
-   No sound/void on macOS: `macosnosound`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

**doing mappings**

-   What is that \"stash\" in why do I need it? It is your workbench
    doing mappings, you can mess around there before you publish models
-   Doing mappings is complex! Yes, it takes a little getting used to.
    But for each model/livery we only have to do it once, then everyone
    else can use it. It is also more a power user feature, people just
    flying swift will not need to do that. But we need more mappings for
    testing now!
-   How can I see my mappings? See [here \<seemymapping\>]{.title-ref}

**other swift questions**

-   Do I need to add models before I can fly? Yes, you need to create a
    model set before you can fly swift. This gives you full control
    about which models you use.
-   Could I use models not in the database yet in my model set? You
    could, but it is not recommended. Our goal is to have reliable data,
    not fantasy ICAO codes or such.
-   How can I find the log. and data directories: From the \"File menu\"
