If you encounter swift hanging and NOT responding anymore you could
create a crashdump and make this available for the swift team.

Crash dump files
================

-   Here it is described how to do that, easy and simple: \"look for
    task manager\"

-   as the dmp file is quite big please zip it (rar it, whatever) and
    upload it to your shared drive (like Google drive, \...) and send us
    the link

-   Let us know you have that files: <https://discord.gg/R7Atd9A>

Hints
=====

Hanging can have multiple reasons

-   swift has opened a model window but you do not see this window
    because it has opened up on a different screen.
