title: Connecting FS9 manually through multiplayer
---

Should auto-connect between FS9 and swift not work, you will notice that
the status-light on the right side of **sim** is off and swift is not
able to detect the **aircraft model** that you are currently using in
FS9

In order to solve this problem you need to change to FS9 and open the
menu **Multiplayer** and choose **Connect**

In the connect-dialogue, swift\'s multiplayer-session should appear
within a few seconds. Select it and then click on **Join**

After joining swift\'s multiplayer-session, change back to swift GUI and
check that the status-light next to **sim** is lit and that swift is
able to detect your aircraft model
