title: 'dot-commands (.commands), hide dot command tooltip'
---

swift allows to control several features via \"dot commands\" like
`.msg .drv`. The easiest way to get an overview of all commands is using
the tooltip as shown

If you dislike the large tooltip showing all the time you can disable it
by typing `.tooltip` (toggles tooltip help on/off)
