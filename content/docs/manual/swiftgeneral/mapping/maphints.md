Always save your stashing data (then you recover it in case of a crash)

-   Always check if the aircraft already has a mapping (DB icon)

    > -   If you see an existing mapping, which is wrong, we appreciate
    >     very much if you fix it.
    > -   Otherwise, create mappings for non existing aircraft entries.
    > -   see here, entries with and without icon

-   New ICAO codes: `cr`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

-   `effmappings`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Which mappings do we need?
==========================

-   We cannot tell you exactly what mappings to create, as we do not
    know which models you have installed

-   However, it is always good to create mappings for payware aircraft
    (as we definitely can not buy all those).

-   All Libraries we would like to have in the DB

Q&A:
====

-   Should I use the `P3D` for P3D v1-3 or also for v4? We are currently
    evaluating P3D v4, for now use it for all P3D versions.

-   I have the same model installed, but from another distributor, what
    should I do? This can happen, many models are part of multiple
    distributions. Normally there is not need to update the distributor.

-   I have a model, but the distributor is missing? Request the
    distributor, you can already do the mapping and save your stash.
    Later you can fix the distributor. Or you can use `ZZZZ`, publish
    and later change/fix the distributor

-   How can I efficiently create mappings?

    > -   If you place random models on the stash, it will be more work.
    > -   Try to assign multiple attributes at once, e.g. select all
    >     aircraft of an airline and assign those at once
    > -   You can filter your aircraft and stash the filtered only
    >     (example: Filter by aircraft, push result to stash, assign
    >     aircraft ICAO in one step)

-   How do we set the distributor for FS, FSX, P3D standard models? See
    `mapfsstandardmodels`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

-   What are excluded models? See `excludedmodels`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

-   XPlane

    > -   Why are some models excluded ([CSL]{.title-ref} vs
    >     [.acf]{.title-ref} models)? See
    >     `xplanemapping`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    >     `excludedmodels`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    > -   Do we need mappings for [ACF]{.title-ref} models? Yes, see
    >     `excludedmodels`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
