You can enable `matching logs` before you login on the login page
(matching log tab) or on the model matching log tab age. Both ways are
shown below. **In recent \*swift\* version a simplified log is enabled
as per default**.

Using matching logs
===================

Then you can obtain a detailed information about the mapping steps per
callsign. In case you need to report a bug please paste the matching
messages.

Hint: The matching result also depends on the settings:
`matchingsettings`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

If you need a quick overview you can use the model view to see how the
aircraft and livery a mapped.

Uploading a matching log
========================

If you want to discuss results on [our Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/scSWXR), copy the matching log in a file and
upload it for further analysis. **Make sure you copy the whole matching
log**. **Upload as file.**
