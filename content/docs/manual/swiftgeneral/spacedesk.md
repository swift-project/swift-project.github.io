title: Virtual 2nd screen on another device
---

Many people claim you always have to switch between your flight
simulator and the Swift GUI window. I am now going to show you a way to
connect nearly any device as a second display to your PC to place the
GUI on it. Therefore, **Windows 7 or higher** is requiered to be the OS
on the Computer whose screen should be extended and all devices have to
share the\*\* same network\*\* .

**!Before we start be informed that spacedesk is still under
developement and in a Beta state. However, I have never made negative
experiences so far!**

1.  [Download spacedesk](https://www.spacedesk.net/). As it is explained
    on the website, the SPACEDESK DRIVER SOFTWARE for Windows PRIMARY PC
    (server) has to be installed (as its name says) on the machine whose
    screen you want to enlarge. The SPACEDESK VIEWER SOFTWARE for
    SECONDARY Machine (client) is for any client, on which the screen
    should be displayed (also available for iOS and Android).
2.  Open spacedesk on your primary machine. Klick the three dots and
    make sure that the switch is set to \"on\", otherwise the primary
    machine will not be displayed.

*The following is not for iOS and Android app*

3.  Open the spacedesk viewer on your client. If everything is set up
    correctly, it should be displaying something like this:

If you see the message \"Cannot Detect Primary Machine!\", you have
configured spacedesk wrong. Check, if spacedesk is really enabled on the
primary machine and if both clients share the same network. It might
also be, that a newer version has been released. In this case, download
the new versions and try again.

4.  If you open Windows screen settings dialogue on the primary machine
    (this can also be done in spacedesk under Display Settings) you can
    edit position, orientation, resulution and zoom factor of the
    screens.
5.  Now the second screen is treated as a physically connected screen
    and can be used as such. Just pull the GUI or any program over to
    the other screen.
6.  **OPTIONAL:** I configured spacedesk a little further for my
    personal preferences. All following steps are reffered to the
    secondary machine spacedesk dialogue. First, I enabled Mouse and
    Keyboard under the tab Functionality. This enables you to control
    the primary machine with mouse and keyboard of the secondary
    machine. Because I use a laptop with touchscreen functionality as
    secondary device, I also activated Touchscreen (absolute). Under
    Settings, I set hooks next to \"Full screen upon Connect\" as well
    as \"Keep Monitor Active\" (should be self explanatory). Last but
    not least, under Settings - Automatic Connect i entered the name of
    my primary machine (replaced by in the pictures) so I have nothing
    more to do than to start the spacedesk application.

I hope this program can help many people with the GUI struggle.
