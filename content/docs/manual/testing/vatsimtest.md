Prerequisites / disclaimer:

-   You have to be a member of \"alpha users\" and you have to be a
    member of \"VATSIM test users\" .

-   Make sure your profile name has the correct form: \<1st name\>
    \<last name\> \<(VATSIMID)\>

-   Testing means work and can be frustrating

-   You might have to test one issue multiple times

-   The software (might crash/fail at any time)

-   We need testers who stick with the team for a while, at least until
    a feature has been completely tested

-   You need to understand swift model sets and be able to create new
    sets:

    > -   `createms`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    > -   `mm`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

-   You need to to understand how to report bugs:

    > \-- `reportingbugs`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and \--
    > `resolvingbugs`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Please do not work as a tester:

-   if you do not have time for testing, we rely on your feedback and
    testers who do not really \"test\" are just not helpful
-   if you give up easily, there will be problems for sure. Frustration
    is a natural part of software testing.

Best practicse

-   do not stop testing unless something is a show stopper. Many people
    tend to stop testing once they find a bug and wait until this bug is
    fixed. Do not do this: Try to find a work around and continue
    whenever possible.
-   screenshots can be helpful to describe where \"you are in swift\"
    and what you are talking about
-   HELP EACH OTHER, currently we are only 2 swift developers. If you
    manager to answer questions among yourself this will greatly help us
-   fix the documentation here in this wiki if something is not clear
    and you can do it better
