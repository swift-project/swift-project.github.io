title: 'Resolving bugs (review if fixed, then close)'
---

If you (here "Joe Doe") have opened a bug report and then the bug is
(supposed to be) fixed, you have to test, then
` Resolve`it. So developer will set the task to `Review` and
assign it \"back to you\" (Joe Doe in the example).

Then the next steps for you (the one who opened the bug) will be:

- you test if the problem is gone
    - if OK, `Resolve` the task (and we are done here)
    - if still a problem, set to `Unsatisfactory` and assign it back to the developer (Ralf Thorn in the example).
