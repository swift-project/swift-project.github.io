title: 'libxplanemp repo - commit changes to libxplanemp'
---

In general, there are three things to consider:

1.  Don\'t add any [Ref]{.title-ref} in git comments. libxplanemp is
    shared by other projects where it would not make sense.
2.  Style guide: in *swift* we indent by 4 spaces, but libxplanemp uses
    tabs. Comply to avoid huge white space changes and unreadable diffs.
3.  Our {icon code} repository is just a read-only monitor of
    [https://github.com/swift-project/libxplanemp]{.title-ref}. Changes
    must be pushed here.
