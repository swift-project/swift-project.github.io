title: Aircraft classification (model matching)
---

The standard matching for VATSIM of \"normal passenger\" plane / airline
combinations is straight forward. However, some categories are poorly
matched as there is no/little information in the current FSD concept,
like smaller utility aircraft, military aircraft, helicopters etc.

To allow model matching with more details for some aircraft categories
we will add some classification details.

Our classifications are focusing on finding the right model

Aircraft type
=============

1.  Unclassified, all aircraft where we **do not need** further details.
    All the normal passenger aircraft (B737s of airlines, A320s of
    airlines etc.) will be unclassified.

2.  Civil aviation aircraft (this can be used **to make clear** it is a
    freight aircraft). For some types it is clear by the ICAO code, for
    some it is not. This can be used to explicitly set it where needed.

    > 1.  Passenger
    > 2.  Freighter
    > 3.  Mixed

3.  Ultralight

    > 1.  Trike
    > 2.  Powered hang gliders
    > 3.  Powered parachutes

4.  Military combat airplanes

    > 1.  Fighter aircraft
    > 2.  Bomber
    > 3.  Multi role combat aircraft
    > 4.  Gunship
    > 5.  Glider (military glider only)

5.  Military helicopters

    > 1.  Attack helicopters

Aircraft details
================

Like the combined we could use a simple string representation to
classify further details

-   Number of wings, biplane `2W`, triplane `3W`:

-   Number of rotors, like `1R`, `2R`, `2RC` (coaxial), `2RT` (Tandem),
    see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_rotor>

-   Undercarriage, mostly required to distinguish smaller `L1P` planes

    > -   Taildragger, Tri-cycle Float Monowheel, skids (like for
    >     helicopters) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_gear>
    > -   not planned something like this:
    >     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercarriage_arrangements>

Aircraft period

Some hints in which period this aircraft belongs. Not to detailed, but
maybe something like this:

-   WWI
-   WWII
-   and so on

Q&A
===

FS: \"Doesn\'t the classification for mil. helicopters make sense for
all military aircraft?\", see
[here](https://dev.swift-project.org/T472#12476).

-   We have a military flag which allows to classify any model or ICAO
    code as \"military\"? (we keep this one)
-   This works well for a military B737/A320 where I can tell it is a
    B737/A320 used by an airforce etc. If the airforce itself has an
    official ICAO code, I can even tell which airforce it is.
-   On the other hand, in most cases there is no such information, if
    someone uses as a F15 and someone has no F15 in its model set, what
    would be a reasonable representation? At least I would like to
    display another fighter jet (if available), So displaying a Phantom
    F4 would be IMHO be better than a B737. From the ICAO information I
    can hardly distinguish those, both `L2J`.
-   I found that splitting helicopters and fixed-wing planes allow us a
    better granularity, and there are classifications which are mutual
    exclusive, but maybe we can also just merge both categories and
    distinguish fixed wing/rotorcraft by the ICAO info or the newly
    established \"details\"
