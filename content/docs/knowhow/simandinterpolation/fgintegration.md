About
=====

This module allows FlightGear to connect to an externally running
*swift* client.

*swift* is an open-source pilot client for multiple flight simulators
(FSX, P3D, FS9, XPlane, FG) and operating systems (Windows, MacOS,
Linux). It allows connections to FSD servers like VATSIM. Further
information about *swift* can be
[here](https://datastore.swift-project.org/page/about.php).
