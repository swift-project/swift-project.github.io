title: Alpha Q and A (questions and answers)
---

I am confused about all the sites
=================================

Can be explained: \* This site (<https://dev.swift-project.org>) is
about swift development and bug reports \* The datastore
(<https://datastore.swift-project.org>) contains the mappings and alpha
users can download the swift development versions. \* The alpha
downloads can be downloaded from
<https://datastore.swift-project.org/page/alpha.html>

What is SSO?
============

SSO means single sign on, you do not need an extra username/password but
you can use your VATSIM credentials.

I cannot login with with VATSIM SSO
===================================

Do a simple test, try to login to <https://forums.vatsim.net> If SSO
does not work with you? \* If not, there is a problem with your VATSIM
credentials - you need to clarify with VATSIM. \* If this works and not
with datastore, let us know \* **Other hint:** if you have a 6 digit
VATSIM id, try to add a leading 0: 123456 -\> 0123456 \* If this still
does not work, contact us via

Installation
============

-   Please read `installation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} chapter
    directory concept.

General
=======

-   My account is not approved yet. We approve users step by step (in
    waves). We want to handle user requests/issue before we accept new
    users testing
-   Where can I file bug reports?
    `Here <reportingbugs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, check the
    `status page <status>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} first.
-   Why is there no voice in the YouTube tutorials? Simple, matter of
    time. They are subtitled because subtitles can be easily added and
    adjusted - so resources is the reason
-   Why is A and B not happening, happening faster etc.? Resources,
    easiest way of speeding up things, join and do it. Are capacity
    limit is reached.
-   I did not get a response to my query? Be patient, or ask again.
    Hobby project, limited resources (maybe we should set up a telephone
    hotline holding queue as in professional projects\]\]
-   In the alpha chat room, how to disable all the email notifications?
    Go to the top of the page, settings, you can change it there

Updates
=======

-   Check the `status page <status>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
    see if something is ready
-   Currently you have to manually download, improved feature in
    development
-   You can override a swift installation, or just delete the folder.
-   Close swift before updating.
