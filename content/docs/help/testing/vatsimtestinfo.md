title: VATSIM test info
---

We are going to start integration tests for VATSIM with a small team. If
you are interested in helping with the tests, please let us know. If you
are already registered here <https://dev.swift-project.org> please check
out `vatsimtest`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} .

You can contact us like described in `contact`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} .

The most important requirement for us is that you have some time for the
testing and you are not easily giving up. There will be some frustration
for sure (as some things will go wrong), but we need you to stick with
the team and continue. Resolving problems is an iterative task.

We are going to start with a small team. As we are looking for some
variety please let us now your simulator, OS - furthermore we need your
VATSIM id as only specified users can use the client on VATSIM (that is
how it is done on VATSIM). The registration with VATSIM will need some
time, so please allow some days for that procedure.

After that you can create your first model set and start (you can also
create new DB entries for models you want to use). Then just try to fly
and let us know the problems. But please provide detailed information
for us to resolve problems. Also monitor the reports of the fellow
testers, so you understand which issues are still in resolution.

Also:

-   make sure your email is valid
-   make sure your VATSIM id is part of your user\' fullname, like \"Joe
    Doe (123456)\", see Registration and naming conventions
