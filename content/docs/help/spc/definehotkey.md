General:
========

-   Hotkeys as the push to talk (PTT) button can be defined under
    settings -\> hotkeys
-   Hotkeys can be **keyboard keys** or **joystick buttons**
-   Hotkeys are machine dependent , when you use a distributed version
    of *swift* the hotkey can originate from your local machine or the
    remote machine

Troubleshooting and testing:
============================

-   if a combination is not working **delete it and add it again**. It
    can be that the identifier of the key has changed and the code hence
    is not recognized).
-   if you want to test a particular key combination, you can assign the
    \"swift hotkey test message\" (see screenshot). You will see a small
    popup when you press the key combination (indicating the combination
    works).
