---

**To temporarily change label-settings from within X-Plane**

-   In X-Plane open menu Plugins-\>xswiftbus, there is a line to toggle
    aircraft labels. This setting is **not permanent**, but only valid
    for your current session of X-Plane.

**To //permanently// save label-settings:** \* in swiftGUI proceed to
`SETTINGS` \*\* select `SIMULATOR` and click on `[...]` next to X-Plane.
\*\* This will open a new window where you can check/uncheck your
aircraft label status. \*\* Changes will be saved when closing swiftGUI.
