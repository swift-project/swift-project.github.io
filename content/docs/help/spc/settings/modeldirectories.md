title: Simulator model directories
---

The model directories can be configured under simulator settings here:

-   you can change these settings in the pilot client, mapping tool and
    the launcher
-   note the grayed out entries, in the settings, these are the values
    use if you DO NOT change (override) those, the default values are
    used
-   changing the values here does NOT automatically update the model
    list and model set, the new values are affecting the paths in the
    model set when you re-create it. See `createms`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} .
-   See `modelsetandsettings`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   XPlane example: `xpmodeldirectories`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
