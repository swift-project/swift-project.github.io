title: Aircraft range and max. aircraft number (aka visibility range)
---

You can restrict the number of aircraft and the maximum range of
rendered aircraft. We do not recommend to do so, unless you have
particular reasons for that, as it can lead to surprising results
(especially restricting number of aircraft) .

`CLEAR` removes the restrictions.

Disable all aircraft
====================

If in some situations you need to disable all rendered aircraft you can
do this from the context menu.
