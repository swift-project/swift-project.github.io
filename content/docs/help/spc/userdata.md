title: swift user data
---

You can find your swift user data in the application data directory,
which depends on the OS you are using. On Windows this directory will be
`AppData/Local/org.swift-project`. As you can install multiple swift
versions on your system, you might see a directory for each of those
installation. Within such a directory you will find sub directories for
log, cache, and settings data.

You can also access these directories from your swift applications\'
File menu.

Hint: In the `launcher_wizard`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} you can
transfer settings and cache data between different swift installations.
