title: Interpolation log. display window
---

The interpolation log. display allows to trace interpolation, checking
elevations, inbound parts and situations. It is most likely the easiest
was to trace interpolations. See also
`interpolationexamples`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} .

Interpolation log. files are here: `findlogfiles`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} -\> Interpolation log. files

-   Use `.drv intdisplay` to launch the window

-   You can start logging by entering a callsign. This is the same as
    starting logging from interpolation setup or via dot command, only
    easier.

-   You can also request the scenery ground elevation from the
    simulator.
-   On the \"inbound page\" you are seeing the incoming situations and
    parts from the network

-   Especially the altitude information and the used elevation is a
    useful information there
-   The calculate aircraft change states can be checked from the next
    page

-   On the \"interpolation page\" you can check the latest interpolation
    or inject a scenery ground elevation for testing
