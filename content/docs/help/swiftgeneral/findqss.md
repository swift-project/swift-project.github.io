Those files are overridden with any update of swift, so you would need
to backup your changes
:::

The *swift* stylesheet files (aka *swift* `qss` files) sever the same
purpose as [css
files](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) for HTML.
If you want to change the appearance of *swift* you could change those
files. See also `thirdparty`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} .

The `qss` files are located in the swift install directory in the qss
subfolder
