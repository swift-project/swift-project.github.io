title: 'Model set - add new models'
---

If you have installed new models there is no need to re-create your
model set. In case you want to completely re-create your set you can
find that here: `createms`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

There are 2 steps involved:

-   update your stored models, in most cases it is the easiest way just
    to force a reload

    > -   In the mapping tool, go to the \"Own models\" tab.

    > -   If you need to **reload your models** you can use the [FORCE
    >     RELOAD]{.title-ref} context menu.

-   then you find the new models ad add them to the model set

    > -   you can sort by column to find the latest models
