Duplicates
==========

Normally it does not make sense to keep more than one aircraft/livery
combination in your set. You can find out more about your model coverage
from the statistics, see `tuningset`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} .

Remove duplicates
=================

You can remove duplicates from the model set context menu.

-   If you now press \"Ok\", the models from that list will be removed
    your set, however the changes are not saved yet.

If you are unhappy with the changes, you can just \"refresh\" with the
currently save data. This will discard the changes.
