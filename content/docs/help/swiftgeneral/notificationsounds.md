title: Tweaking swift notification sounds
---

*swift* notification sounds can be found under your installation path
under sounds: `swift-0.8.7-64bit\share\sounds`. Starting with *swift*
0.9.1 you can have your own sounds directory and any file found there is
used instead of the *swift* file

-   the file names are self-explantory
-   if you place the corresponding file in your directory you will hear
    the \"new sound\" (restart required)
-   You can test the sounds in the audio settings (if you select a
    notification sound the sound will be played)
-   to use a new file you need to restart *swift*

Share your sound files
======================

If you have cool sound notification files you can share them with other
users.

-   the files have to be in `.wav` format
-   and **have to be copyright free so we can publish them here**
-   we need your CLA, see
-   Upload your file
-   all uploads without real name will be ignored (legal reasons)
-   you can find shared files under `thirdparty`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
