title: XPlane gear always up / animations not working
---

-   If you see your gear always up, or animations not working (in
    XPlane), see `troubleshooting`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    (\"animations\")
-   Another reasons is if the other client sends wrong parts, see
    `interpolationexamples`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
