title: Crash reports / enable crash dumps
---

swift can send crash reports to our server, so we can check what is
going wrong. However, this is also a privacy issue, as we need to send
detailed information.

A crash report includes

-   detailed information about your swift installation and runtime
    environment
-   your IP address
-   information about your computer hardware

We will store the information until we have resolved the issue and then
delete it. You can help us a lot if you enable crash reports, but if you
have privacy concerns just disable it.
