title: See and use done mappings
---

If you have created mappings you might wonder how you can see them:

::: {.important}
::: {.title}
Important
:::

Normal users creating change request have to wait before we accept the
changes. Before that the are still invisible for you.
:::

New DB data can always be downloaded via context menu (right mouse)

If you want to update your models or model set, try \"Consolidate\".
This will go to the DB, check for new/changed data and update your
entries.
