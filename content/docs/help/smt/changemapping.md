Let\'s say you want to fix/change a particular mapping.

-   locate this mapping in the mapping DB data

-   here I find it by its id, but this is is just an example

-   you could also find it by other filter criteria

-   then you mark this model and stash it, `ALT + s` also works

-   changing a model requires to login
-   now it can be changed in the mapping editor under stashed models
