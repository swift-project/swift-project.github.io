title: Maintain multiple model sets
---

You can keep and save multiple model sets. The idea is that you can
create specialized model sets for events, or just tryout a new set.

The model set can be saved from the context menu.

The model set can be loaded from the context menu or the \"load button\"
beneath the model set view
