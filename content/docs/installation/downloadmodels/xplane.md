## Bluebell Models
-   Downloaded BB and opened the zip

-   After extracting this looks like this

- Now the offset fix, without that models would appear too low, see [here]({{< ref "xplanecg" >}})

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
Make sure to install that correctly, sometimes users install that one directory level too low, you must replace the `xsb_aicraft.txt` files
{{% /alert %}}
- Normally it will be correct if you need to override the overwriting

- You can also check you see the offset in the `xsb_aircraft.txt` file

- Working folder example:

- **WRONG** folder example, cascaded (\"Airbus in Airbus\")

- **WRONG** folder example, offset file folder in `BB` folder

## X-CSL

To get the X-CSL model sets you need to use the **X-CSL Updater
program** that you will download from the [X-CSL
homepage](https:*csl.x-air.ru/). It is also suggested to create a
subfolder for X-CSL inside X-Plane\'s \"Custom Data\"-folder to help you
organize your model sets.

> 1.  **download** X-CSL Updater from <https://csl.x-air.ru/>
> 2.  **extract** the *X-CSL Updater* ZIP-file to a directory of your
>     choice
> 3.  **create a new folder** inside *Custom Data* where you will store
>     all X-CSL models, for example *..X-Plane 11Custom DataCSLXCSL*
> 4.  **start the X-CSL Updater**
>
> > -   open File-menu =\> **Set X-Plane location** =\> browse to your
> >     X-Plane directory, select X-Plane.exe
> > -   open File-menu =\> **Set custom path** =\> confirm warning with
> >     OK =\> browse to your newly created X-CSL folder within X-Plane,
> >     for example *..X-Plane11CustomDataCSLXCSL*
> > -   in the X-CSL Updater program click on **Index** on the bottom
> >     right
> > -   select the model sets from the list that need installation or
> >     updating and then click on **Update**. It may take a while to
> >     finish, depending on the number of models

When you are done you can close X-CSL Updater and start *swift\'s*
**Mapping Tool** (*swiftData*), because now you\'ll need to update your
\"Active Model Set\". For this please refer to our respective Tutorials
and help pages.
