## Download

Download the latest installer from [here](https://github.com/swift-project/pilotclient/releases).

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
You **need to use the 32-bit installer for FSX, FS9 and Prepar 3D (v1-v3)** even if you have an 64-bit operating system because SimConnect for FSX is 32-bit only. For **X-Plane and P3Dv4 or later** use the 64bit installer.

You might see a warning when you start the installer:

You need to ignore this as we have no official MS certification.
