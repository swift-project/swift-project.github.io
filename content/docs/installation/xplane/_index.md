## Install XSwiftBus

*swift* - in contrast to other X-Plane clients - is running outside of
the X-Plane process. In order to communicate with the X-Plane process
and render AI aircraft, a small plugin called XSwiftBus is necessary. It
needs to be installed into `X-Plane/Resources/plugins`. This wizard will
download and install it for you.

-   Confirm the install directory is correct or change it as necessary.
-   Check and correct the temporary download folder.
-   Choose a version to install (it is strongly recommended to use the
    same version as swift itself).
-   Click on `download`.
-   Answer `Ok` in the dialog to extract and install the package
    directly into X-Plane.
-   In case 7z is not available on your machine (Mac OS users!), you
    will receive an error message and will have to extract it yourself.
-   It is recommended to keep the default for the connection settings.
