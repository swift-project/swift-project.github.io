-   Downloaded BB and opened the zip

-   After extracting this looks like this

-   

    Now the offset fix, without that models would appear too low, see `xplanecg`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    :   -   Important: Make sure to install that correctly, sometimes
            users install that one directory level too low, you must
            replace the `xsb_aicraft.txt` files
        -   Normally it will be correct if you need to override the
            overwriting

        -   You can also check you see the offset in the
            [xsb\_aircraft.txt]{.title-ref} file

        -   Working folder example:

        ![image](http://img.swift-project.org/bb5.png)

        -   **WRONG** folder example, cascaded (\"Airbus in Airbus\")

        ![image](http://img.swift-project.org/bb6.png)

        -   **WRONG** folder example, offset file folder in `BB` folder
