## Download

Download the latest installer from [here](https://github.com/swift-project/pilotclient/releases).

## Run the installer

After downloading, modify the installer to be executable `chmod +x swiftinstaller-linux-64-<version>.run` and double-click on it in your favorite file browser or run it from console `./swiftinstaller-linux-64-<version>.run`

If you encounter any problems then see [troubleshooting]({{< ref "troubleshooting" >}}).

## Initial configuration

You've successfully installed swift. Congrats!

You can now move forward to start the configuration. [Click here]({{< ref "simselect" >}})

## Self-compilation

As usual for Linux programs you could theoretically self-compile swift as it is open-source. Unfortunately a secret key is needed to allow swift connect to official VATSIM servers. This key is build into the official installers.

So if you plan to use swift on VATSIM you need to use the installer. Otherwise you can use your self-compiled version. See here for more information.
