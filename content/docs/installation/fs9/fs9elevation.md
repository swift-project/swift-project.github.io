title: FS9 elevation (FS9 aircraft too high/low)
---

-   FS9 has no ground elevation probe
-   and no gnd. flag for MP airplanes

The solution is to use the own aircraft\'s elevation as field elevation.
In order to use that you need to enable this option.

In that case you would use your ground elevation within 250meters.
