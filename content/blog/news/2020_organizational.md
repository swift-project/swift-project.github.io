  swift moving to github
---

1. swift is about to move to Github. Further information will be posted when the transfer has been completed.
    1. The site https://dev.swift-project.org/ will disappear and equivalent services will be provided by Github instead.
        * This includes the source code, user manual, and issue tracker which will all be hosted by Github.
    2. The swift database will be moved to another server.
    3. Discord will remain as is.
2. As a result you might face temporary downtimes of those services. This will NOT stop you from using swift for online flying. We will try to keep those downtimes to a minimum.
3. Klaus Basan will be retiring from his position with swift (**private** reasons) and no longer be available for support questions regarding swift.
