## Fixed issues in 093


## What is AFV?


Audio for VATSIM (AFV) is the new voice codec for VATSIM, more
information can be found here and here.

VATSIM will be offline for scheduled maintenance for 24 hours, from
2019-10-13 2000z until 2019-10-14 2000z. During that time, the network
will migrate over to the new codec, and the old codec will stop working.
If you want to continue using swift 0.9.2 beta after that time, you will
need to install an extra piece of software: the AFV standalone client,
which works on Windows only.

## Voice room connect error (swift 0.9.2)


-   If you use 0.9.2 or earlier, you might see that error. It happens
    because VATSIM now uses some invalid voice room URLs.
-   Solution: use 0.9.3. if you dare, but read the above.
