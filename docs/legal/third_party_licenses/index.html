   &#34;Legal Entity&#34; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   &#34;control&#34; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   &#34;You&#34; (or &#34;Your&#34;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   &#34;Source&#34; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   &#34;Object&#34; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   &#34;Work&#34; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   &#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   &#34;Contribution&#34; shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#34;submitted&#34;
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#34;Not a Contribution.&#34;

   &#34;Contributor&#34; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 Contact: http://www.qt.io/licensing/

 You may use, distribute and copy the Qt Toolkit under the terms of
 GNU Lesser General Public License version 3, which is displayed below.
 This license makes reference to the version 3 of the GNU General
 Public License, which you can find in the LICENSE.GPLv3 file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http: //fsf.org/
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
licensedocument, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

 As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.

 “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

 An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

 A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
Version”.

 The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

 The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

 You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

 If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
    to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
    this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

 The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.

4. Combined Works.

 You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.

    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

    d) Do one of the following:

        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
        this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
        Corresponding Source.

        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
        the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run
        time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s
        computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
        Linked Version.

    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
    otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
    of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application
    with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
    4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
    use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in
    the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
    Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
    it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
    the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that published version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

                      Version 1.0, January 1, 2003
The Qwt library and included programs are provided under the terms
of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL) with the following
exceptions:
    1. Widgets that are subclassed from Qwt widgets do not
       constitute a derivative work.
    2. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
       Qwt library does not constitute a derivative work
       and does not require the author to provide source
       code for the application or widget, use the shared
       Qwt libraries, or link their applications or
       widgets against a user-supplied version of Qwt.
       If you link the application or widget to a modified
       version of Qwt, then the changes to Qwt must be 
       provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
       1, 2, and 4.
    3. You do not have to provide a copy of the Qwt license
       with programs that are linked to the Qwt library, nor
       do you have to identify the Qwt license in your
       program or documentation as required by section 6
       of the LGPL.
       However, programs must still identify their use of Qwt.
       The following example statement can be included in user
       documentation to satisfy this requirement:
           [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
           the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net).
